## [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com) in Scala 3

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

### Notes

Each day is a separate sub-project which is generated by a `scaffolding` project via `sbt run <day number>`
That results in a following structure:
  .
 ├──  README.md
 └──  src
    └──  main
       ├──  resources
       │  ├──  input-test-p1.txt
       │  ├──  input-test-p2.txt
       │  └──  input.txt
       └──  scala
          ├──  dX.scala
          ├──  dXp1.scala
          └──  dXp2.scala

where `X` is a number of the day.

`input-test-p1.txt` contains test data for part 1
`input-test-p2.txt` contains test data for part 2 (can be different from the part 1 test data)
`input.txt` contains the real data for the day for both parts

`dX.scala` is not expected to be modified and is used only to run the code for a day

`sbt run test 1` will run `dXp1.scala` against the `input-test-p1.txt` data
`sbt run test 2` will run `dXp2.scala` against the `input-test-p2.txt` data

`sbt run main 1` will run `dXp1.scala` against the `input.txt` data
`sbt run main 2` will run `dXp2.scala` against the `input.txt` data
